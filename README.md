The delay app enables Aragon organizations to require a configurable delay between when an intent is sent and when it is executed.

#### ðŸš¨ Security Review Status: Contracts frozen for audit as of commit 

The code in this repo has not been audited.

## How does it work?

The Delay app keeps track of the time left until scripts can be executed, the script to execute, and the time that the script was paused at.

### Initialization

The Delay app is initialized with the `_executionDelay` parameter. This defines the default length that a user will have to wait to execute a delayed script, provided it is not paused at some point during the delay.

### Roles

The Delay app should implement the following roles:

- `SET_DELAY_ROLE`: This allows for setting a delay.
- `DELAY_EXECUTION_ROLE`: This allows for executing a delay once it is past it's delay window.
- `PAUSE_EXECUTION_ROLE`: This allows for pausing a delay.
- `RESUME_EXECUTION_ROLE`: This allows for resuming a paused delay.
- `CANCEL_EXECUTION_ROLE`: This allows for cancelling a delay.

### Interface

Check out our [user guide](./docs/user-guide.md) to go through the functionality of the app.
